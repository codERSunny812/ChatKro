# Process
1. ### Planning and Setup
   The development process began with thorough planning to outline the project's requirements, features, and technologies to be used.
   
2. ### Backend Development
   We built the backend using Express.js to create RESTful APIs for user authentication, message handling, and video call functionality.
   
3. ### Frontend Development
   With the backend in place, we focused on frontend development using React. We designed and implemented the user interface, leveraging React hooks and state management libraries for efficiency.
   
4. ### Testing and Debugging
   Thorough testing was conducted to identify and address any bugs or issues. Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests were performed to ensure reliability.
   
5. ### Deployment and Optimization
   The application was deployed to a hosting platform, with optimization for performance, scalability, and security. Continuous integration and deployment pipelines were set up for smooth updates.
   
6. ### Monitoring and Maintenance
   Monitoring tools were implemented to track the application's performance, uptime, and user activity. Regular maintenance and updates were performed to address security vulnerabilities and enhance user experience.
